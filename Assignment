## 1. Using problem 3 in week 1, write functions for the following:
    1. Collecting the inputs for the problem. Convert the inputs to the relevant types they should be.
    2. Calculating the equation given the inputs from the above.
    3. Printing your result in a preformatted string.
    
    Ensure to include a main program that reads the values from the user.
    
 def converter(feet = float(input("Please enter measurement in ft:"))):
    inches = round( feet * 12, 2)
    yards = round(feet / 3.0, 2)
    miles =  round(feet / 5280.0,2)
    print(f"This is feet to inches:", (float(inches)))
    print(f"This is feet to yard:", (float(yards)))
    print(f"This is feet to miles:",(float(miles)))
converter()
    
    
 # 2 Write a function that takes three numbers as parameters, and returns the mean value of those parameters as its result. Include a main program that reads three values from the user and displays their mean.

def Meanscore():
    score1 = int(input("Enter score 1:"))
    score2 = int(input("Enter score 2:"))
    score3 = int(input("Enter score 3:"))
    mean = round((score1 + score2 + score3) / 3, 1)
    
    if mean > 80:
        print("You made it!")
    else:
        print("Until next time")
    print(f"Mea of total score {mean}.")    

Meanscore()
